    \begin{enumerate}
        \item So $\{f_n\}_n \in A[[T]]$ is a sequence of elements such that $f_n
            \in {(T)}^n$. Then we can define $f = \sum^{\infty}_{n = 0} f_n$,
            because every coefficient will have only finitely many summands.
            Then we have $f - \sum^{n}_{k = 0} f_k \in {(T)}^{n+1}$ by
            the definition of $f$. Also, if there would be $g \in A[[T]]$ which
            is not equal to $f$ at the coefficient at degree $m$, then $g -
            \sum^{m}_{k = 0} f_k \notin {(T)}^{n+1}$.
        \item Suppose $A$ is noetherian.
    \end{enumerate}
