    First we translate the case of finding $x, y, z \in \Z$ to finding rational
    points on $x^2 - d y^2 = 1$.

    We do exactly like in the lectures, we consider the line $L_q$ that goes
    through $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, q)$. It intersects the hyperbola at exactly one
    point. We may assume $x \geq 0$, $y \geq 0$ and $q \geq 0$, since everything
    is symmetric.

    We calculate and see that the line $L_q$ will intersect the hyperbola at the
    points $\left( \frac{1+dq^2}{1-dq^2}, \frac{2q}{1-dq^2} \right)$ and $(-1,
    0)$. Also, if we take a rational point $(x, y)$ on the curve, the line
    through it and $(-1, 0)$ will have rational slope, namely $q$ with $q =
    \frac{y}{x+1}$. That way we have a map from rational points on the curve to
    $\Q$. These two maps are each others' inverse.

    For every $q \in \Q$ we get the solution
    \begin{equation*}
        (x, y, z) = (1 + dq^2, 2q, 1 - dq^2).
    \end{equation*}
